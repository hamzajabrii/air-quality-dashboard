# Air Quality Analysis

## Description

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of air quality data to understand pollution trends and their impact on the environment. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Streamlit**, the dataset is processed and visualized to provide valuable insights into air quality levels over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive dashboard

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes air quality measurements from various locations over a specific period. The data consists of information such as:
- **Location** (e.g., Geo Place Name)
- **Pollutant Types**
- **Pollutant Levels**
- **Time Period**
- **Data Value** (e.g., PM2.5, PM10)
- **Dataset Link** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing or incorrect data entries
- **Data Visualization**: Generate interactive plots to explore trends and correlations
- **Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit to display key metrics and visualizations in an easy-to-navigate interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
